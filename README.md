# Hills
Hills is a two-feet-on-the-ground, down-to-earth, polder-style approach to modulation, inspired by Mutable Instrument's Peaks.

### Features
- LFO (goes _reeeal_ slow)
- ADSR envelope generator
- Line generator
- Random Sequencer (inspired by MTM's Turing Machine)
- Dual channel operation
- Multiple control modes

## Using the Hills reference design
The code and schematics in this repository are a proposed way of implementing this specific feature set. Read: I'm just getting started in the world of designing electronics, so there's probably way more effective ways to do all these things. Feel free to add and give feedback where necessary.

With that said, the reference design should be enough for any user who just wants to get this thing going. For starters:
